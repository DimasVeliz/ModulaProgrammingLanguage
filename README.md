# This is a repository for the Modula Programming Language

The Modula Project is intented to be a simple programming language with a C#-Pythonish flavor. 

## variable declaration
```
let myNumber = 4
let mySecondNumber = myNumber + 7
let myThirdNumber = myNumber
```
## operators available
```
+
-
*
/
```
## functions built in or available
```
sin(x)
cos(x)
eval(x)
graph(x)
max(x,y)
min(x,y)
sqrt(x)
pow(x,y)
```

## function definition

```
def myFunction(x) = 4*sin(x)
def mySecondFunction(x)= (myFunction(x) +1)/3
def myThirdFunction(x,y) = 2*pow(y,y)+x
```
